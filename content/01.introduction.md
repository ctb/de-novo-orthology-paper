## Introduction

There are a predicted $8.7$ million Eukaryotic species on earth \cite{Mora:2011go}, yet only $14\%$ ($1,233,500$) have been catalogued and $0.001\%$ ($9,449$) have genomes deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information Genome Assembly \cite{noauthor_genome_nodate}.
And yet, the genome sequence is not enough.
To truly understand the diversity of life on this planet, we need to determine not just the DNA blueprints of life, but understand the instantiation of the DNA, the cell types of the species.
While sequencing DNA gives a quantitative measure of the nucleotide differences, it does not inform the functional strategies that change with DNA sequence.
As new species can be defined by a new cell type.
For example, the existence of a single cell type, the Cnidocyte (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cnidocyte), a stinging cell of a single-celled biological weapon, defines the phylum Cnidaria.Thus, entire clades, not only species, can be defined by the introduction of an additional cell type or state.

Novel organizations of existing cell states can also define cell types.
For example, the develompent of genitalia in amniotes, while using similar cell types, ultimately uses a different physical organization of cell types to generate genitalia in mammals compared to reptiles \cite{Tschopp:2014fl}

Determining common gene ancestry ("orthology") is a difficult problem.
Many approaches exist \citet{Forslund:2017cu}.

Determining common ancestry of cell types ("orthologous cell types") [CITE: ARENDT2016 etc] is an additional difficult problem.
Comparative transcriptomics begins with finding a common feature set for embedding molecular profiles across divergent species into a common space.
Many researchers take the approach of using one-to-one orthologous genes [Cite: brawand2011, CCA, LIGER, Scanorama, basically all the single cell "alignment" packages], others use clusters of orthologous groups\citet{tatusov2000cog}, others map reads onto a common genome derived from whole-genome alignment [cite: recent primate brain paper from Barbara Treutlein].
