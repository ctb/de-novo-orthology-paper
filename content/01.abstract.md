## Abstract


Single-cell RNA-sequencing is a powerful technology for identifying novel and known cell types, however its power is limited to organisms with well-annotated genomes.
We demonstrate the utility of using annotation-agnostic methods which quantify cell-cell similarity using $k$-mer profiles.
We benchmark a few methods and demonstrate the utility of converting cell types from mouse to human and back, and compare to using purely 1:1 mapped orthologous genes.
