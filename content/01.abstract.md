## Abstract

We introduce `oolong`, a novel computational method for translating RNA-seq reads to putative protein sequence.
identifying orthologous cell types discovering *de novo* orthologous genes across species.
The direct assignment of protein-coding sequence skips both traditional alignment and gene orthology assignment it can a) be applied to transcriptomes from organisms with no or poorly annotated genomes, b) predicts protein-coding sequences from raw RNA-seq reads, and c) identify putative functions of protein sequences contributing to shared cell types.
For widespread accessibility and usage, we implemented `oolong` into two distinct Nextflow pipelines following software best practices such as testing and continuous integration: (1) `nf-core/kmermaid` to compare translated transcriptomes across divergent species, and (2) `czbiohub/nf-predictorthologs` to infer functions of translated sequences.
By enabling analyses across divergent species' transcriptomes in an orthology-, genome- and gene annotation-agnostic manner, `oolong` illustrates the potential of non-model organisms in building the cell type evolutionary tree of life.
