Table: Dayhoff and hydrophobic-polar encodings are a reduced amino acid
alphabet allowing for permissive cross-species sequence comparisons. For
example, the amino acid sequence `SASHAFIERCE` would be Dayhoff-encoded
to `bbbdbfecdac`, and HP-encoded to `phpphhhpppp`. {#tbl:sequence-encodings}




## Applications

### Installation

`sencha` can be installed with the Anaconda package manager, `conda` (preferred),

```
# Note: not actually on bioconda yet ... this is aspirational
conda install --channel bioconda sencha
```

or from the Python Package Index (PyPI) with the Python package manager, `pip`,

```
# Note: not actually on PyPI yet ... this is aspirational
pip install sencha
```

### Prediction of protein-coding sequences across a variety of species

We used `sencha translate` to obtain putative protein-coding sequences from a comaparative transcriptomic dataset spanning nine species and six tissues [@doi:10.1038/nature10532].

### Read preprocessing

As the protein-coding score is assessed on the entire read, we recommend RNA-seq reads be removed of library artifacts to the best of the user's ability.
This means, the adapters should be trimmed, and if there was a negative insert size such that the R1 and R2 reads overlap, then the read pairs should be merged.


#### Creation of amino acid $k$-mer database with `sencha index`

Before predicting protein-coding sequences, `sencha` must create a database of known amino acid $k$-mers, which is stored in the form of a probabilistic set membership data structure known as a bloom filter.
`sencha` uses the bloom filter implementation in `khmer`/`oxli` [@doi:10.12688/f1000research.6924.1; @doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0101271], called a NodeGraph.
We created a dataset of known amino acid $k$-mers from the manually annotated UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot databases [@doi:10.1093/nar/gky1049; @doi:10.1007/978-1-4939-3167-5_2].
We used only protein sequences observed in *Opisthokont* species [@url:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opisthokont], previously known as a "Fungi/Metazoa" group that encompasseses "Fungus-like" *Holomycota* and "Animal-like" *Holozoa*. [NOTE: Does this need a figure/phylogenetic timetree?]

```

#### Prediction of protein-coding sequences with `sencha translate`

We then predicted protein coding reads using the created bloom filter using `sencha translate`.

![Applications of `sencha translate`. **A.** We simulated RNA-seq data using Opisthokonta species from the Quest for Orthologs dataset for true positive protein-coding RNAs, reads completely contained within intergenic, intronic, and UTR sequences as true positive noncoding RNAs, and reads partially overlapping a coding and noncoding region as an adversarial test set.
