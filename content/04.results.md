## Results

To determine whether short segments of sequences could detect gene orthologues, we $k$-merized orthologous genes derived from the ENSEMBL version 97 [@doi:10.1093/nar/gkx1098] COMPARA database [@doi:10.1093/database/bav096] (Fig.~\ref{fig:fig1}).
We compared human protein sequences to orthologous chimpanzee, mouse, (orangutan, bonobo, gorilla, macaque, opossum, platypus, chicken) protein sequences, as these are species used in [@doi:10.1038/nature10532].
As a background, we randomly chose 10 non-orthologous genes relative to the human gene.
In addition to $k$-merizing the protein-coding sequence, we also re-encoded the protein-coding sequence into Dayhoff [@raw:dayhoff1969atlas] and hydrophobic-polar encodings [@raw:phillips2012physical], show in Table~\ref{tab:encodings}.

Table: Dayhoff and hydrophobic-polar encodings are a reduced amino acid
alphabet allowing for permissive cross-species sequence comparisons. For
example, the amino acid sequence `SASHAFIERCE` would be Dayhoff-encoded
to `bbbdbfecdac`, and HP-encoded to `phpphhhpppp`. {#tbl:example-id}

We found that, consistent with previous knowledge, that 1:1 orthologues had higher $k$-mer similarities as determined by the Jaccard Index.


Additionally, more recently diverged genes had higher $k$-mer similarity as well.
